# Virtual Paint Project

### Description

##### The Project consists of two files 

- Color Picker : A particular color marker is extracted using appropriate values of hue, saturation and value . To achieve this I have created trackbars to smoothly                    extract the required color marker. Using this we can get appropriate range of HSV values for different markers with respect to our surrounding.
   
- Virtual Paint Project : This file consists of the main functionalities of the project which ranges from detecting the colour of the marker which we are holding to                             successfully following our hand and accordingly drawing on the computer screen.
